Representation Learner Usage
=============================

All implementations of representation learning algorithms in this codebase are built around one central abstraction,
which is, perhaps not surprisingly, a class called `RepresentationLearner`. This class defines the
general framework by which components of representation learner training happen. Design of different variants of
RepL algorithms is accomplished by creating a learner which takes in and runs different implementations of those component steps.


Training a Pre-Defined Representation Learner
---------------------------------------------

Here is an example of training a simple, pre-defined representation learner:

::

    from il_representations.algos import SimCLR
    simclr_model = SimCLR()
    loss_record, encoder_path = simclr_model.learn(datasets=x, batches_per_epoch=100)
